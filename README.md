Disclaimer: this notebook is intended for educational purposes only. Do NOT attempt to use it as a diagnostic tool. Furthermore, with only 180 available images, the results do NOT constitute a scientific evidence that AI is capable of detecting Covid-19 with an acceptable degree of accuracy.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. In this notebook we will explore the feasibility of using AI-based solutions to detect the presence of the virus in patients through chest x-rays. The images are taken from [https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset] and [https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia]. You can try the notebook in Google Colab by opening Covid_19.ipynb and clicking on "Open in Colab".
